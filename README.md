# Outline

## Functionality

* Login 
* Redirection to a page consisting of multiple components:
    * Header 
    * Footer
    * Content Area
        * "Hello" page
        * "World" page
* Backend logic written in Node.js framework (to demonstrate) connectivity

## Possible Non-Functionals

* Appliction should demonstrate pluggable authentication.
* Application should demonstrate pluggable CTI integration (something like Amazon Connect).

* Pages should be sourced from different URLs in the content area: and should successfully register and unregister themselves based on navigation.
* Page registration should be agnostic to the type of framework they are written in.

* A least one piece of data should be persisted on the client side between page navigations.
* Elements should be built out of web components - or a framework that emits components
